  "issues": [
    "Handle grasps are concentrated on one side of the handle, limiting coverage for different orientations.",
    "Some green (handle) grasps appear to be on the inner curve of the handle, which may lead to collisions or unstable grips.",
    "Orange (body) grasp is singular and located near the handle, which may not be ideal for balanced lifting."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Add more handle grasps on the opposite side of the handle to improve coverage for different orientations.",
    "Ensure handle grasps are positioned on the outer surface for better stability and reachability.",
    "Consider adding a body grasp on the opposite side of the mug to balance the grasp distribution."
