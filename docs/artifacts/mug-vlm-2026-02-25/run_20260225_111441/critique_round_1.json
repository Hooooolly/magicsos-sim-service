  "issues": [
    "Grasps on the handle (green) are clustered near the attachment point and lack coverage of the handle's full length; some may be unstable due to thinness.",
    "Rim grasps (cyan) are mostly concentrated on one side; coverage is uneven, and some may be difficult to reach without collision from certain angles.",
    "Only one grasp on the body (orange) is insufficient for robust picking from various orientations."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Add grasps along the full length of the handle, especially near the middle and far end, to improve stability and coverage.",
    "Distribute rim grasps more evenly around the circumference to support picking from any orientation.",
    "Add at least one more grasp on the body to provide alternative, stable options for picking."
