  "issues": [
    "Handle grasps are concentrated on the outer curve and lack coverage on the inner side and top surface of the handle.",
    "Some handle grasps have approach vectors that may collide with the cup body or are too shallow for stable grip.",
    "Rim grasps are mostly on the top edge but lack diversity in approach angles, especially from the side views."
  ],
  "suggestions": [
    "Add grasps on the inner surface and top of the handle to improve coverage and stability.",
    "Distribute rim grasps more evenly around the circumference with varied approach directions.",
    "Consider adding a few grasps on the cup body near the base for alternative picking orientations."
